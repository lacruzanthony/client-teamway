# Project to join Teamway community.

The idea is to create this behavior from [Psychologies](https://www.psychologies.co.uk/test/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert/?answers=#test) where we have some questions about personality.

We select the answer and the 'Next >' button is activated, we click it and answer the next answer.

At the end, we could see our type of personality (is a random choice) and retake the test.
